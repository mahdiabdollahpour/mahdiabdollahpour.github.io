During my free time, I always enjoy playing soccer over at UofT's [Back Campus Fields](https://kpe.utoronto.ca/facility/back-campus-fields). I'm also a fan of tennis, and I usually head to UofT's [Athheltic Center](https://kpe.utoronto.ca/facility/athletic-centre) or the public parks downtown to hit some balls.

Speaking of hobbies, I'm really into reading books, especially Fantasy, Sci-Fi, and History. If you're into those genres too, let's connect on [Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/61438150-mahdi-abdollahpour) and share our favorite reads.
