How to attack a model
========
This paper introduces concept of Membership Inference Attacks Against
Machine Learning Models. Membership inference is determining whether a
given data record was part of the models training dataset or not. This can
be dangerous because sometimes training data could be sensitive data. This
problem is investigated in black box scenario in which adversary can only
supply input to model and get the output.
